# TankInvasion
Twin Stick shooter game made in Adobe Animate


This is the older version of the Multiple Room Version. This version has new rooms that spawns after a certain amount of portals have spawned. The game now scales to how many rooms have spawned instead of how many portals have spawned. Each room is harder than the next. This version also includes audio for shooting, death, ect..
